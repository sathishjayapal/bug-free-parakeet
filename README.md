# Welcome to your CDK Java project!

* cdk init app --language java
* mvn compile -q
* cdk ls
* If you are using a Java IDE, it probably has a simpler way to add this dependency to your project, such as a GUI for editing the POM. We recommend editing pom.xml by hand because of the use of the cdk.version variable, which helps keep the versions of installed modules consistent.

## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`       cks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
 * `cdk deploy` To deploy the stack using AWS CloudFormation
 * `cdk diff`   To see these changes, we'll use the cdk diff command
 * `cdk destroy`   Enter y to approve the changes and delete any stack resources.

Enjoy!
